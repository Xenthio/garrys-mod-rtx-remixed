## Known issues
### Vanilla
- Shader skyboxes (gm_flatgrass, gm_construct, etc) cannot be interacted with and may have rendering issues
- Some render targets (spawnmenu icons, screenshots, whatever addons that rely on them) do not appear or behave strangely (investigating)
- NPC Eyes do not render as the fixed function rendering fallback no longer exists (investigating)
- Some particles will not render (need to change each material from $SpriteCard to $UnlitGeneric to fix)
- Some maps will be rasterized and have vertex explosions.
- Some map lights will cull even with Lightupdaters active (investigating)
- Enabling `r_3dsky` causes rendering issues

### Addons
- High vram usage from addons like ARC9 or TFA as they precache textures on map load
- Tactical RP scopes become invisible when using ADS
