## Known issues
### Vanilla
- Shader skyboxes (gm_flatgrass, gm_construct, etc) cannot be interacted with and may have rendering issues
- Some render targets (screenshots, whatever addons that rely on them) do not appear or behave strangely (investigating)
- NPC Eyes do not render as the fixed function rendering fallback no longer exists (investigating)
- Some maps are rasterized and also have vertex explosions.
- Some map lights will cull
- Enabling `r_3dsky` causes flickering in some maps
- Skinned meshes have unstable hashes

### Addons
- High vram usage from addons like ARC9 or TFA as they precache textures on map load
- Tactical RP scopes become invisible when using ADS
